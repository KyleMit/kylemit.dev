## About Me (Kyle)

![profile](/assets/profile.jpg)

I've been writing software for the last decade or so at StackOverflow, DealerPolicy, the Vermont Department of Health, code camps, meetups, and online. I'm primarily focused on web dev, react, dotnet, and azure, but always in the mood to debug something new.
